# Motivation & Problems

- Many elderly and visually impaired people have limited access to sports activities
- Lack of feedback during exercises can lead to injuries
- Traditional fitness solutions often require specialized equipment or supervision
- Current technology solutions are not accessible for people with visual impairments
- Goal: **Barrier-free, safe and guided movement**

---

# Our Vision

- An AI Coach that detects movements **live** with computer vision
- Provides **auditory feedback** in real-time
- Promotes independence and health
- Accessible to everyone, easy to use
